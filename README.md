# Wear_OS_Temperature_Watch_App
Bachelors Degree's Thesis about design and devolpment of a simple simple watch app based on the device sensors.

A watch app based on Wear OS which can monitor, register and examine data about ambiental temperature.

This project has been realized as part of my final thesis for my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering in Bologna, published with the title "Progetto, Sviluppo e Valutazione delle Performance di Applicazioni su Android Wear OS" regarding Wear OS by Google.

This Watch App lets the user put his/her name, surname and city with the virtual keyboard provided on the smartwatch screen and, by pressing the according virtual button, register the ambiental temperature detected by the watch sensors. This operation can be repeated multiple times changing the values or not. Then by swiping right or by pressing the dedicated virtual button the user can consult the temperature readings previoulsy done and even filter them by city.

The point of this project was to build a fully functioning prototype of watch app following the best prectice examined in the earlier sections of the thesis
